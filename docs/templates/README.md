# Templates — the artifacts `/progix` and the workflow instantiate

These are the canonical sources for the human-facing artifacts of a project. Skills fill them in; humans read them. Keeping the master here (versioned, gated) means every project starts identical and improvements compound.

| Template                                                 | Filled by                                                      | Lives (when filled)                                                           |

Rule for all of them: human-readable first (the PM, Ilyes, and the client read these), short, honest, and dated. See `docs/process/notion-workspace.md`.
